# Discrete Choice Experiment Simulator

The package `dcesimulatr` provides a flexible controlled environment for discrete choice experiment simulation. 

At this moment, the package supports only minimal number of behavioural theories and preset experimental design configuration. 
We hope that in near future, the number of available functionnalities will increase. 



# Installation

For now, the package resides in an old repository, keeping the previous naming convention, which may rise confusion:

```
devtools::install_github("nikitagusarov/dcesimulatr")
```

Alternatively, you may use the old repository:

```
devtools::install_github("AntoineDubois/dcesimulatr")
```
